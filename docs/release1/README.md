## RELEASE 1

## WHAT WE HAVE DONE

In the firste release of Periodtracker, the main focus has been on the set up and basic functionality

Things we have implemented in the first release:

- A basic set up of the project
- The app in running in gitpod
- A GUI which allows the user to create their own user, or log in if they already have a user. This takes them to a near empty site which we plan on improve within the next releases.
- We implemented logic in conjunction with filewriting and reading to store and collect data. When the user creats a new user, it is written to users.txt. If they at a later time log in, the app will read from this file to check if they actually have a user
- Basic test for user (age and name specifically)
- Maven is used to build the project 

In the release 1 and 2 we aim to expand the functionality in the already existing classes, although we may need to add 1 or 2 more classes. 

## WORK HABITS

Teamwork was essensial for us. The first meeting we had, we brainstormed different ideas for what kind of app we wanted to make. We also made a Trello page where we had bulks of what had to be done in the group, and what each one of us had to do. 

From there we had regular meetings where we updated each other on what we had done, and often times choose to code together during these meetings. We often worked in pair on different issues. 

In the start of the project, we were not the best with git. As we learned more about git and its functions, the structure and contents got better. We used issues, branches and mergerequest in a broader scale. 

## HOW WE IMAGINE THE USER INTERFACE TO BE WITH A FINISHED APP

This is how we imagine the startpage to our finished product will look.
